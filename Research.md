# Research, Framework

## Breadth and Depth of IDEs nowadays
Software development environments have been predecessed by general text editors, all starting with the „Mother of All Demos“ (cite: moggridge).

Alan Kay was also involved in the Smalltalk programming language, which was the first one to be accompanied with a class browser.

Today, IDEs make use of many general UI patterns and adapt them to their needs. The tree view, for example, is used in class browsers as well as „project explorers“, which serve as a hybrid between file browsers and project-related, non-file nodes (logical nodes) within a software project.

The IDE landscape is today more differentiated than ever, ranging from minimal, purpose-specific environments like Processing to huge, general-purpose, commercial environments like Visual Studio. Those different IDEs serve the needs of different developers and development situations. But still, it seems like there are many niches that are yet to be filled with new IDEs. Especially the area of web development (frontend development) is seeing many newcomers, for example Github’s Atom Editor, Adobe’s Brackets and Eclipse Orion, all based on Node.js and other web technologies.

- A Short History of Code Creation & IDEs; Alan Kay, smalltalk, etc


## Design Patterns in IDEs
- Graphical User Interface, general patterns: navigation, integration of different tools. pattern elements: source code, the gutter, highlighting
- Mouse and keyboard (shortcuts) as input
- Modes (vim, larry tesler against modes, diff. configurations in eclipse, on-the-fly hide/show in sublime text/atom etc)

## Programming concepts that are important
- Runtime & Creation Time
- Syntax & Semantics
- Scope & Context

## Survey & Interviews



- Existing patterns that are relevant to mine
- Goals: understanding, less errors/mistakes
