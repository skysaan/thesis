\section{Breadth and Depth of IDEs
nowadays}\label{breadth-and-depth-of-ides-nowadays}

Software development environments have been predecessed by general text
editors, all starting with the „Mother of All Demos“ (cite: moggridge).

Alan Kay was also involved in the Smalltalk programming language, which
was the first one to be accompanied with a class browser.

Today, IDEs make use of many general UI patterns and adapt them to their
needs. The tree view, for example, is used in class browsers as well as
„project explorers“, which serve as a hybrid between file browsers and
project-related, non-file nodes (logical nodes) within a software
project.

The IDE landscape is today more differentiated than ever, ranging from
minimal, purpose-specific environments like Processing to huge,
general-purpose, commercial environments like Visual Studio. Those
different IDEs serve the needs of different developers and development
situations. But still, it seems like there are many niches that are yet
to be filled with new IDEs. Especially the area of web development
(frontend development) is seeing many newcomers, for example Github’s
Atom Editor, Adobe’s Brackets and Eclipse Orion, all based on Node.js
and other web technologies.

\item
  Graphical User Interface, general patterns: navigation, integration of
  different tools. pattern elements: source code, the gutter,
  highlighting
\item
  Mouse and keyboard (shortcuts) as input
\item
  Modes (vim, larry tesler against modes, diff. configurations in
  eclipse, on-the-fly hide/show in sublime text/atom etc)
