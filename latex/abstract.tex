The Model--View--Controller design pattern is used in many software
architectures to provide a
clear application structure. Following the principle of \emph{Separation of Concerns},
it decouples business data from business logic and presentation, and thus improves reusability and maintainability.
With the use of MVC in web applications,
the challenge emerges to apply the pattern to client--server environments.
The result of distributing the pattern components on client and server
is a range of different architecture variations.

%, are applicable for web applications following different requirements.

The applicability of these web architecture variations based on Model--View--Controller
is examined in this thesis by means of different application requirements.
To demonstrate the shift from thin to rich client web applications, the
architecture of \emph{IBM Content Navigator} is presented as an example.
The development of a plug--in for IBM Content Navigator further illustrates
how rich client MVC applications can effectively be implemented.
