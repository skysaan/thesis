Programming language tools help software developers to understand a
program and to recognize possible pitfalls. Used with the right
knowledge, they can be instrumented to achieve better software quality.
However, creating language tools that integrate well into the
development environment and workflow is challenging.

This thesis utilizes a user-centered design process to identify the
needs of professional developers through in-depth interviews, address
them through a concept, implement and evaluate the concept through
contextual inquiry. Taking \emph{scope} as an exemplary source of
misconceptions in programming, a „Scope Inspector“ plug-in for the Atom
IDE is implemented, targeted towards experienced JavaScript developers
in the open source community.
