**Research Question**: *How can an IDE support the understanding and exploration of scope & context in a programming language to deepen understanding and help prevent errors?*

- IDE giving semantic support in code creation
- Understanding asynchronous control flow in IDEs // nope!!!
- Understanding and exploring scope and context
