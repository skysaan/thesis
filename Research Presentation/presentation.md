# Survey

## ~40 participants so far

---

# Survey

* Incredible breadth of different IDEs / code editors
* Documentation is mostly *searched for* on the web
* Autocompletion is *more or less helpful*
* Asynchronous code is *hell* and IDEs don’t help much
* Navigation of code relies on the developer’s *memory*
* Syntax highlighting has mostly a *subconscious*, visual purpose

---

# Interviews

## 4 out of 8 so far

---

# Interviews

1. Different platforms, languages & workflows require completely different tooling
2. The problem is usually *understanding*
3. The **basics** (syntax highlighting, autocompletion, browsing, searching) can still be worked on
4. Lightweight IDEs miss comfort, heavyweight IDEs are too slow

---

# Results

## Possible concept focus
- Syntax highlighting made semantic
- Autocompletion
- Visualizing asynchronicity
